This is the repo for Assignment 3 - Grid/Flexbox

## CSS Frameworks / Flexbox Page

Starting with the grid.css file used in class, create a simple page grid in a single
HTML page. Add sample content (text and images, sample images are provided but
content is up to you) in Flex containers to create consistent alignment of content, and
blend CSS Grid with custom Flexbox styling to make the content responsive.
